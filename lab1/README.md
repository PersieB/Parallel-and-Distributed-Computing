# Lab 1
This folder concerns the first lab assignment in my Parallel and Distributed Computing.
The lab was divided into 2 parts: one to research on the top HPC Machines and possible applications in Ghana,
and the other to familarize and understand the Unix programming environment.

# Part 1
Task:
I was required to read and write about the 5 top HPC machines in the world as of November
2020 [1] and the top HPC machine in Africa. Features expected to be derived from the machines
should include but not limited to:
• Rank
• location
• URL
• Manufacturer
• Memory
• Number of Cores
• Processor Type
• Manufacturer
• Interconnect
• Linpack Performance
• Theoretical Peak
• Power consumption
• Operating System
• Any other interesting features
Comment on what applications and problems in Ghana such machines can used for and challenges
and limitations in Ghana that one would encounter in operating such machines.

NB: The report can be found in the documentation branch section of the repository. It is also included in this folder (lab1) for easy access.

# Part 2
Task:
This part was meant to familiarize and understand the Unix programming environment by compiling and running programs such as 
ones which use the OpenMP and PThreads Libraries. The source codes are included in this folder for reference.
