# Lab Assignment 3

## Outcome
At the completion of this exercise, a student should be able to:
i.)  Write  simple  and  reasonable  advanced  parallel  applications  using  introductory  to  mediumconcepts of the MPI message passing interface;
ii.)  In particular, use the concept of derived MPI data types;
iii.)  Utilise a master-worker model of computing
iv.)  Time the execution of MPI algorithm;
v.)  Determine the performance efficiency of the algorithm.

## Task
Performing matrix multiplication using MPI derived data type and the simplistic approacjh of row and column block partioning.


## CLONING AND RUNNING
Clone the repository using `git clone repository https://github.com/PersieB/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing.git` in a folder

# Repository Branches
The github repository has 2 branches, namely "master" and "documentation".

# Master branch
The master branch contains the Lab3 (or any lab) folder that should be cloned to access the source codes. 
NB: A README.md is also attached in each lab folder.

# Documentation branch
The documentation branch contains the report for each lab including Lab3 report.

# Accessing source code
Since the main branch is the default, you can simply to the Lab folder in your unix environment.

# Accessing report from documentation branch
Simply use `git checkout documentation` to move from the master to the documentation branch in your terminal.
The folder will be updated and show only the reports. To switch back to master branch, use the `git checkout master`.
The folder will be updated to reflect only files in the master branch i.e lab folders containing source codes.
